        <p>
            ACE Engineering College was established by Yadala Satyanarayana Memorial Educational Society with the fundamental objective of nurturing the group of nascent talent of young minds aspiring to make career in engineering into a pool of valuable and employable engineers. In addition, they understand their responsibility to willfully render services to the society with dignity and accountability.

The Academy, a premier coaching center for GATE, ESE(IES) and Public Service Commission selections conducted by various state governments for recruitment of engineering graduates, is the most sought after coaching center and has been consistently contributing toppers to all the premier technological institutions in India viz., IITs, IISc, NITs and other universities. The Academy, in the last two decades of its committed services in the training and coaching sectors for engineering graduates across the country, has produced toppers in Engineering Services, as also state service Commissions recruitments.
